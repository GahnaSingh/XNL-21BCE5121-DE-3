Real-Time Fraud Detection System


Overview:This project implements a real-time fraud detection system for financial transactions using an AI-powered pipeline. The system is designed to process high-throughput streaming data, detect fraudulent activities in milliseconds, and prevent suspicious transactions.

Technologies Used: Apache Kafka is used for real-time data streaming. Apache Spark Streaming handles data processing. PostgreSQL serves as the structured data storage. Python is used for data processing and machine learning. Feature engineering is applied to extract user behavior, geolocation, and transaction patterns.

Project Structure
1. Data Ingestion & Pipelines
The system streams financial transactions from banks, payment gateways, and APIs while handling both structured (SQL, NoSQL) and unstructured (JSON, logs) data. Apache Kafka is used for event-driven architecture. A real-time ETL pipeline is implemented using Spark Streaming.

2. Feature Engineering & Model Training
Transaction patterns, user behavior, geolocation, and device metadata are extracted. Processed data is stored in PostgreSQL. A fraud detection model is trained using machine learning techniques.

3. Real-Time Fraud Detection
Spark Streaming is utilized for real-time anomaly detection. Fraudulent transactions are predicted based on historical data. Auto-prevention mechanisms are implemented to block suspicious activities.

4. Deployment & Monitoring
The fraud detection system is deployed using Kafka and Spark. Real-time transactions are monitored, and alerts are logged for anomalies.

Installation & Setup:Kafka, Spark, PostgreSQL, and the necessary Python dependencies must be installed. The Kafka broker and Zookeeper should be started. Spark Streaming is launched for real-time data processing. PostgreSQL is connected, and the required tables are created. Finally, the fraud detection model is executed.

Usage:Kafka Producer and Consumer can be started using the following commands:

javascript-
kafka-console-producer --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic transactions  
kafka-console-consumer --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic transactions --from-beginning  

Spark Streaming can be run with:
nginx
Copy
Edit
python spark_streaming.py  


Transactions can be monitored using PostgreSQL queries to fetch and analyze data, along with a dashboard or logging system to visualize fraud patterns.
